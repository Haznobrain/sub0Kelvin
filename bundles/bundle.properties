block.sub0kelvin-d2-brass-router.name = Brass Router
block.sub0kelvin-d2-brass-router.description = Splits items inputted at the back between the sides and front equally. Brass is the only cheaply available suitable material for the repetitive mechanical actions these may have to perform millions of times.
block.sub0kelvin-d3-brass-overflow-gate.name = Brass Overflow Gate
block.sub0kelvin-d3-brass-overflow-gate.description = Outputs items to the side if the front is blocked.
block.sub0kelvin-d4-brass-underflow-gate.name = Brass Underflow Gate
block.sub0kelvin-d4-brass-underflow-gate.description = Outputs items to the front if the sides are blocked.
block.sub0kelvin-d4-brass-underflow-gate.details = [accent] Why are we even using red beryl in these? \n [blue] These usually perform a lot more movement throughout their useful life so harder material is required for their bearings.
block.sub0kelvin-d5-brass-bridge.name = Brass Bridge
block.sub0kelvin-d5-brass-bridge.description = Capable of transporting items above other blocks for a maximum of three tiles. Directional. Brass is used here as neither nickel nor copper alone can support their own weight.

#production blocks
block.sub0kelvin-p1-solar-lens-panel.name = Solar Lens Panel
block.sub0kelvin-p1-solar-lens-panel.description = Focuses what little sunlight there is to evaporate ice under itself creating steam. Connects to adjacent panels, creating a common pool of steam.
block.sub0kelvin-p2-basic-steam-heater.name = Basic Steam Heater
block.sub0kelvin-p2-basic-steam-heater.description = Dissipates heat from steam in a small radius around itself constantly, allowing blocks in range to survive the cold.
block.sub0kelvin-p3-brass-kiln.name = Brass Kiln
block.sub0kelvin-p3-brass-kiln.description = Uses friction losses to heat up copper and nickel enough to make brass, requiring a lot of steam to do so.

#drills
block.sub0kelvin-d1-steam-drill.name = Steam drill
block.sub0kelvin-d1-steam-drill.description = Uses steam to both rotate and heat up its drilling bit, allowing it to pierce the ice and reach materials beneath.

#core n shi
block.sub0kelvin-e1-core-pyre.name = Core: Pyre
block.sub0kelvin-d1-steam-drill.description = An arctic environment storage container repurposed and given a unit to protect it and build. While fragile, it still can survive the cold better than other cores.

#liquid!!!! nghhg!!!!!!!!!!!!!

block.sub0kelvin-l1-liquid-tube.name = Liquid Tube
block.sub0kelvin-l1-liquid-tube.description = Transports liquids and isolates them mostly from external temperature. If broken, liquids freeze at the end blocking the pipe and stopping a leak from occuring.
block.sub0kelvin-l2-brass-liquid-router.name = Brass Liquid Router
block.sub0kelvin-l2-brass-liquid-router.description = Splits inputted liquids in 3 directions equally. While the splitting is simpler brass is used here due to its corrosion resistance and higher strength.
block.sub0kelvin-l3-brass-liquid-junction.name = Brass liquid junction
block.sub0kelvin-l3-brass-liquid-junction.description = Allows two tubes to cross without mixing.
block.sub0kelvin-l4-brass-liquid-bridge.name = Brass Liquid Bridge
block.sub0kelvin-l4-brass-liquid-bridge.description = Allows liquid to cross over a maximum of three tiles. Requires more brass due to the pipe thickness required to handle actual pressure.
block.sub0kelvin-l5-brass-liquid-container.name = Brass Liquid Container
block.sub0kelvin-l5-brass-liquid-container.description = An insulated container capable of storing a decent amount of liquids. Also acts like a larger liquid router.

# units
unit.sub0kelvin-u1-torchere.name = Torchere
unit.sub0kelvin-u1-torchere-description = A unit made to resist the cold of 1Joule. Can only build and mine, has to use turrets or other units to defend.

# walls

block.sub0kelvin-w1-red-beryl-wall.name = Red Beryl Wall
block.sub0kelvin-w1-red-beryl-wall.description = A wall made of red beryl. Blocks lasers and has a bit of armor due to the material's hardness.
block.sub0kelvin-w2-large-red-beryl-wall.name = Large Red Beryl Wall
