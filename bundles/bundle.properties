item.sub0Kelvin-i1-cut-ice.description = "Water ice cut off of the planet's surface. At this temperature it is suitable for use as an actual material."
item.sub0Kelvin-i2-nickel.name = "Nickel"
item.sub0Kelvin-i2-nickel.description = "A common somewhat soft metal found in most planets' cores and crust. Useful by itself or in alloys."
item.sub0Kelvin-i3-copper.name = "Copper"
item.sub0Kelvin-i3-copper.description = "A common malleable metal useful in plumbing, electricity, and as ammo due to its weight and plentifulness. Also can alloy with nickel to make brass."
item.sub0Kelvin-i4-brass.name = "Brass"
item.sub0Kelvin-i4-brass.description = "An alloy of copper and nickel, much harder and more resistant than either, it also does not corrode."
item.sub0Kelvin-i5-red-beryl.name = "Red Beryl"
item.sub0Kelvin-i5-red-beryl.description = "A hard material with uses for for exemple lasers. It is a beryl crystal with chromium impurities."
item.sub0Kelvin-i5-red-beryl.details = "[accent] Why does upper management insist that this is beryl? this is clearly ruby, are they stupid?\n [blue] There's extra tax on rubies and other rare gems in trade, we wanna avoid that.\n [yellow] ah, the usual, i see."

liquid.sub0Kelvin-l1-steam.name = "Steam"
liquid.sub0Kelvin-l1-steam.description = "Water vaporized from surface water ice."
#distribution blocks
block.sub0Kelvin-d1-coldproof-duct.name = "Coldproof Duct"
block.sub0Kelvin-d1-coldproof-duct.description = "Protects items from freezing but is not actually immune to being damaged by the ambient cold."
block.sub0Kelvin-d2-brass-router.name = "Brass Router"
block.sub0Kelvin-d2-brass-router.description = "Splits items inputted at the back between the sides and front equally. Brass is the only cheaply available suitable material for the repetitive mechanical actions these may have to perform millions of times."
block.sub0Kelvin-d3-brass-overflow-gate.name = "Brass Overflow Gate"
block.sub0Kelvin-d3-brass-overflow-gate.description = "Outputs items to the side if the front is blocked."
block.sub0Kelvin-d4-brass-underflow-gate.name = "Brass Underflow Gate"
block.sub0Kelvin-d4-brass-underflow-gate.description = "Outputs items to the front if the sides are blocked."
block.sub0Kelvin-d4-brass-underflow-gate.details = "[accent] Why are we even using red beryl in these? \n [blue] These usually perform a lot more movement throughout their useful life so harder material is required for their bearings."
block.sub0Kelvin-d5-brass-bridge.name = "Brass Bridge"
block.sub0Kelvin-d5-brass-bridge.description = "Capable of transporting items above other blocks for a maximum of three tiles. Directional. Brass is used here as neither nickel nor copper alone can support their own weight."

#production blocks
block.sub0Kelvin-p1-solar-lens-panel.name = "Solar Lens Panel"
block.sub0Kelvin-p1-solar-lens-panel.description = "Focuses what little sunlight there is to evaporate ice under itself creating steam. Connects to adjacent panels, creating a common pool of steam."

#drills
block.sub0Kelvin-d1-steam-drill.name = "Steam drill"
block.sub0Kelvin-d1-steam-drill.description = "Uses steam to both rotate and heat up its drilling bit, allowing it to pierce the ice and reach materials beneath."
